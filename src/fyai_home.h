 * exposure (a read-only mask of the paths of /proc that change the kernel), and the
 * private home (`home: {private: true}`), and set ctx->home. The private home is
 * a tree that is mounted over the real home, so the tools see the same paths and
 * the real files are hidden. It holds the private versions that `copy` and `env`
 * name, each at its own place: a directory is an overlay of the original, so
 * nothing is copied and the original never changes, or, with `method: copy`, a
 * copy that shares the blocks of the original where the file system can, as the
 * content store does. A file is a copy. Each path that the sandbox grants under
 * the home, the project among them, is mounted into the tree first, so it stays
 * visible. A source that a `deny` entry covers is left out. The mounts are made in
 * the namespace of each tool, which needs a cover. Call it in the process that
 * forks the tools, before the fork; it does nothing in a tool child and when the
 * mounts exist. Returns 0, or -1 after it reported why.
